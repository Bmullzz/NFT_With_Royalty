# Markdown File 1: ERC721A
- How does ERC721A save gas?
    - When popular NFT projects begin to mint, gas prices spike, resulting in higher gas fees for the entire ecosystem.
    - ERC721A can save significant gas by minting multiple NFT's in a single transaction when compared to the minting costs for OpenZepplin's IERC721 and IERC721Enumerable.
    -ERC721 also has 3 major Optimizations that allow it save on gas:
        - Optimization 1: Removing duplicate storage from OpenZepplin's ERC721Enumberable.
            - IERC721Enumerable includes redundent storage of each token's metadata.
            - This approach optimizes for read functions at a significant cost to write functions, which is not ideal given that users are much less likely to pay for read functions. 
            -ERC721A's tokens are serially numbers from 0 to N which allows them to remove redundant storage from the base implementation.
        - Optimization 2: Updating the owner's balance once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT.
        -Optimization 3: Updating the owner data once per batch mint request, instead of per minted NFT.
